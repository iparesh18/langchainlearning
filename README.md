# 🤖 What is LangChain? (Beginner-Friendly)

**LangChain** is the framework that lets you build advanced AI systems like:

- ChatGPT-style apps  
- Perplexity-style search agents  
- Autonomous AI agents  
- Tool-using AI (search, scrape, browser, DB queries)  
- RAG systems (Retrieval Augmented Generation)  
- Multi-agent workflows  
- AI automations  

In simple words:

### 👉 *LangChain = the API that gives your LLM a brain + memory + tools.*

With LangChain you can give your model the power to:

- Run functions  
- Use tools  
- Search the internet  
- Scrape websites  
- Execute multi-step workflows  
- Process data  
- Work with embeddings + vector search  
- Create intelligent agents  

This repo teaches all of that **step-by-step**.

---

# ❓ Why Learn LangChain? (What It Solves & Why It Matters)

Modern AI apps are **not just LLM calls** anymore.

Real-world AI systems need:
- Memory  
- Tools  
- Multi-step reasoning  
- Internet search  
- Web scraping  
- File processing  
- Database querying  
- Agents that can plan & act  
- Strong orchestration  
- Workflow control  

**LLMs cannot do these things alone.**  
This is where **LangChain + LangGraph** come in.

---

# 🚀 What LangChain Solves

### ✔️ 1. Turns your LLM into a “programmable agent”
LLMs alone = text in → text out  
LangChain = LLM + Tools + Memory + Functions  
Now your AI can:

- search the internet  
- scrape websites  
- run code  
- call APIs  
- access databases  
- use functions  
- follow workflows  

This is how ChatGPT Tools, Perplexity, and BrowserGPT work.

---

### ✔️ 2. Standardizes tool usage (Functions, Runnables, Tools)
You don’t have to manually write:
- LLM → reasoning → tool → combine results → final output

LangChain handles:
- input formatting  
- tool calling  
- function schemas  
- conversions  
- parallel execution  
- mapping & sequencing  

Everything becomes clean, modular, reusable.

---

### ✔️ 3. Gives LLM Short-Term & Long-Term Memory
With:
- Runnables  
- Output Parsers  
- Embeddings  
- Vector Stores  
- RAG pipelines  

You can build:
- Memory agents  
- Knowledge assistants  
- Personal AI  
- Chatbots that remember context  

---

### ✔️ 4. Play nicely with *any* LLM
Supports:
- OpenAI  
- Gemini  
- Anthropic  
- Local models  
- Ollama  
- HuggingFace  
- Cloudflare AI  

Your code stays the same even if the model changes.

---

# 🔥 What LangGraph Solves (Why It's the PERFECT Combo)

LangChain gives you **tools**,  
but LangGraph gives you the **brain** to control them.

LangGraph provides:
- Nodes (steps)  
- State management  
- Conditional edges  
- Routing  
- Multi-agent flows  
- Cycles + loops  
- Workflow orchestration  
- Re-entry + persistence  

This is EXACTLY how:
- Perplexity agents  
- ReAct agents  
- Supervisors  
- Tool routers  
- Multi-agent systems  
are built.

---

# 🤝 LangChain + LangGraph = The Agentic Power Combo

Together they let you build:

### 🔷 Autonomous multi-step agents
LLM thinks → chooses tool → uses tool → updates memory → repeats.

### 🔷 Perplexity-style search systems
Search → scrape → summarize → final answer.

### 🔷 Browser automation agents
Use Puppeteer → extract content → feed to LLM.

### 🔷 Real-world AI backends
With:
- routing  
- memory  
- tools  
- scraping  
- search  
- pipelines  
- multi-agents  

Exactly what modern AI companies use.

# 🎯 One Line Summary

**Learn LangChain to give your AI tools.  
Learn LangGraph to give your AI a brain.**

Together they let you build **real AI systems**, not toy chatbots.

# 📌 About This Repository

This is an **open-source, ongoing, continuously-evolving LangChain JS learning project** created by **Paresh**.  
The goal is simple:

👉 **Teach LangChain JS from absolute zero to advanced with clean, runnable examples.**  
👉 **Each topic = a self-contained lesson (folder) with its own README + code.**  
👉 **Explained in ELI5 style: super simple, super practical.**

This repository is structured like a **hands-on course**, not just random scripts.

# 🧱 How to Learn This Repo (Start → End)

Many people get confused where to start, so here is the **official recommended order**:

### ✔ Start with `index.js`
This gives you:
- How model initialization works  
- How a basic `.invoke()` works  
- Simple structure before learning chains/tools  

### ✔ Then follow numeric order:

```
01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06 → 07 → 08 → 09 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13
```

Each file builds on top of the previous one.

### **Flow of Learning:**

1. **Basic LLM usage** — index.js  
2. **Prompt Template + Chains** — 01, 02  
3. **Output parsing** — 03  
4. **Custom steps / preprocessing** — 04  
5. **Embeddings + vector search** — 05  
6. **Basic RAG** — 06  
7. **Tools (RunnableLambda)** — 07  
8. **Scraper tool** — 08  
9. **LLM as a tool** — 09  
10. **Agent with scraper** — 10  
11. **Basic LangGraph agent** — 11  
12. **Multi-agent system** — 12  
13. **Advanced multi-agent with real search & scraping** — 13

After these 13, you understand:
✔ LLM basics  
✔ Chains  
✔ Tools  
✔ RAG  
✔ Embeddings  
✔ Agents  
✔ Multi-agents  
✔ LangGraph
